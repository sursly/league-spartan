**Please note:** This typeface has many structural issues and probably needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, by someone with more type design knowledge than myself. You have been warned.

League Spartan Variable
=============

**A new classic, this is a modern, geometric sans-serif that has no problem kicking its enemies in the chest.**

Taking a strong influence from ATF's classic Spartan family. We've put a few unique touches into a beautiful, historical typeface, and made sure to include an extensive character set – currently totalling over 300 glyphs. As of June 2018, it has been converted into a variable font with 5 pre-defined weights.

_In addition, the incredible [Philip von Borries](http://www.vaubee.com) has crafted a beautiful and detailed animated version of League Spartan to accompany the release – partnering with [Animography.net](http://animography.net/products/league-spartan) to expand on it and sell it._

_It's simple and beautiful, and makes some extremely complex, very compelling typographic animations quickly._

_And part of the profits are going right back into supporting The League and making more great stuff, so if you love it, [grab a license today](http://animography.net/products/league-spartan)._
